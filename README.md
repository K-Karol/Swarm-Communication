# Swarm-Communication
This is currently my Y13 EPQ project artefact.
Unity version `5.4.1fa `

## Current status
Blockchain branch was committed even though it isn't strictly finished due to running out of time. The core premise of the project has been demonstrated however, therefore the project is a success 

## Progress

**25/03/2019** Re-Strucure branch is recoding the whole project to establish a foundation. It will be merged into master, but without completed topology. That will be a branch of its own.

**27/03/2019** Finished visuals

**01/04/2019** Started on the blockchain branch

**12/04/2019** 'Finished' the blockchain branch
